# lets look at the idea of another data structure
# a Stack like a stack of plates or books
# LIFO (last in first out)

# we can push items on to the stack 
# we can pop items off a stack
# and we can peek at the item at the top of the stack

# think of how you could utilise a linked list to form a stack
