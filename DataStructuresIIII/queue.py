# lets think of another scenareo where we want to model a line at a store
#  or a queue at the airport

# for this comes the queue data structure
# like the stack we can add and remove data
# this is more like a line of people in a queue

# for this we could enqueue and item on to the data structure
# and we can dequeue an item from the queue

# This data structure works as a FIFO or (first in first out) data structure

# think of how you could utilise a linked list to create a queue

  
"""
A queue is a data structure whose primary purpose is to store and
return elements in First In First Out order. 
1. Implement the Queue class using an array as the underlying storage structure.
   Make sure the Queue tests pass.
2. Re-implement the Queue class, this time using the linked list implementation
   as the underlying storage structure.
   Make sure the Queue tests pass.
3. What is the difference between using an array vs. a linked list when 
   implementing a Queue?
   
Stretch: What if you could only use instances of your Stack class to implement the Queue?
         What would that look like? How many Stacks would you need? Try it!
